## After Bangkit 2022
What are we (MD team) going to do with the app after graduating from Bangkit 2022?

- [@null2264](https://github.com/null2264): I'm planning to at some point in the future complete all the TODO list that we unfortunately don't have enough time to complete during Bangkit 2022, and continue maintaining the app as long as I could.
- [@FATx64](https://github.com/FATx64): Iâ€™m planning too make a new design to make another feature, such as Consultation doctor,Hospital search, and another feature that can be useful for user.
